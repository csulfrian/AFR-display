# Simple Air Fuel Ratio (AFR) dash display
This project uses one of the analog outputs on the Innovate Motorsports LC-2 to calculate AFR and display it on the SparkFun serial 7 segment display. It reacts quickly and is easy to tuck away somewhere that's not in the way but easily looked at. Was originally built around a Arduino Uno, but many other boards can be used. This uses simple one-way UART to communicate with the display.
